## 📖 Course Overview

This subject introduces the fundamental concepts of game design, playful user experience, and interactivity. It aims to enable students to construct narrative interaction designs in the game context based on exploring the principles of interactive storytelling, dynamic game balancing, and user psychology. 

In order to facilitate design iteration, this subject imparts research methods of user-centered design that involve prototype making and user testing to let students gain insights of how players may interact.

### Intended Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this subject, students will be able to:
- Describe the fundamentals of interaction design in game context.
- Apply design skills through prototyping non-digital games.
- Employ the psychological knowledge of human behavior in playing experience to interact with players.
- Outline the history of games to reflect the momentum from relatedness needs among players.
